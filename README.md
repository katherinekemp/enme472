ENME472 Capstone Project, Spring 2022

## About
For the capstone project of my mechanical engineering degree at the University of Maryland, my team and I created a semi-automated hydroponics system for beginners. As a dual computer science and mechanical engineering student, I was the leader of the programming team. I set up a Raspberry Pi with a camera, sensors, and pumps to monitor and maintain the system. I used sqlite to store data about the system and displayed it on a monitor using a Tkinterface with live updates. Lastly, I added text updates for critical errors in the system using Twilio to alert the user to problems.

See [here](https://github.com/katherinekemp/enme472/blob/main/Report\ 4.pdf) to read our thesis and [here](https://github.com/katherinekemp/enme472/blob/main/system.py) for the Python script that maintains the system.
